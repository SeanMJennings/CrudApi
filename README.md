# Crud API
Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) functionality and the corresponding endpoints related to a user.

## Approach taken
- Used TDD working from domain outwards to API.
- Used domain driven design to build user entity comprised of primitives to build in validation.

## Ideas for expansion
- Add more details to user: password (hashed), address, and mobile.
- SPA frontend application over UI.
- CQRS: Separate write and read models for user.
